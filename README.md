# Cameroon-AI-Hackathon-Zindi
The objective of this challenge is to build a machine learning model ( CNN) that can predict if kidneys are in renal failure from ultrasounds.

This solution will be useful in a clinical diagnostic tool used to support clinical decision-making in remote areas. These solutions have the potential to grow into tools to monitor a patient's kidney function and determine treatment plans and hopefully, one day a mobile app to monitor multiple aspects of kidney health. The images are from the Cameroon Health System.
